## LinkedIn Analysis</br>
My motivation behind the analysis was, as an active user on LinkedIn with more than 500 connections. I was curious about the statistics of people in my network & the messages I received over the last 3 years.

<b>LinkdeIn Connection Analysis </b></br>
This report is on analysis of my LinkedIn Connections. The analysis covers target areas such as what kind of companies my connections work for, what kind of roles my connections work in, my connections over time, and more.

<b>How this Analysis can be helpful </b></br>
This report could be used for some designated areas such as,
<li>Network Analysis: If someone is looking to expand their network in a particular field e.g Data Science, then having people from data-science could be helpful in their network, as they might have similar interests. Verifying this kind of stats could be beneficial for someone planning on expanding their network.
<li>Message Analysis: Positive/Negative sentiment on messages about the topic of interest could portray the impact of conversations someone might be having within their network. Here if the sentiment negative shows are more then positive, efforts could be put in for making conversations & posts more influential.


Feel free to try this on your network & connections!
